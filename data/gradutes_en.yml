      - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: My name is Lucia and I am 28 years old. My background is in molecular biology and I have studied animal and natural sciences since 2007. I have lived in Italy and Sweden and speak Swedish, English and Italian. I love to learn new things every day.
      - question: During the summer of 2016, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: After looking for a job as a biologist for two years, I enrolled at Craft Academy. I decided to give it a try because programming has always been a passion of mine. I signed up to give myself a chance to work hard, develop professional knowledge and feel proud of myself.
      - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: During the bootcamp I learned to code, of course, but the most important experience, without doubt, was improving my communication skills. I learned how to work in a group and cooperate with different people and personalities. I have learned to help others and to ask for help, ask questions and give and receive constructive criticism.
    - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
      answer: The bootcamp takes place over 12 weeks, and you have to be prepared that it is not going to be easy! You will definitely be stressed out, tired, frustrated and irritated. The hardest thing is to continue working and studying even when you feel like you want to give up.
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: The only advice I want to give to future students is to never give up. Sometimes it feels like your fellow participants are so much better than you and that they are all learning faster than you. But everyone learns in their own way. If they accepted you into the course, it means you can do it! Continue fighting, never give up. It's worth the pain because the results come in the end.

    - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
      answer: I'm Bo Mattsson. I'm 55, married, and we have three grown children. I worked in the finance industry until 1997 (responsible for Swedbank Securities and was, among other things, the creator of Europe's first online stock trader, NetTrade). After that, I became an entrepreneur and have founded or co-founded three companies, which I have subsequently sold (Eurotrade, Mangold and Cint). Cint was sold in December, 2015 to Nordic Capital.
    - question: In the Fall of 2015, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
      answer: Partly because I like to learn new things (though I can't say it was exactly new, since I did a little coding in the 70s), and partly because I believe it's healthy to have at least a base understanding of how internet communication actually functions, regardless of device. I have the benefit of seeing directly and additionally become healthier
      Dels så gillar jag att lära mig nya saker, per definition (även om jag fuskat litet under 1970-talet med kodning), och dels så tror jag att det är nyttigt att åtminstone ha ett hum om hur kommunikationen på nätet faktiskt fungerar, oavsett device. Det har jag nytta av i den egna verksamheten och dessutom så blir jag nyttigare för andra i samband med investeringar etc.
    - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
      answer: I now understand much better how something is built and what problems the developers have faced. To understand the code makes it easier for me to value the people I hire to build something.
    - question: What would you say was the most challenging part of the training model at Craft Academy?
      answer: If you aren't ready to put all of your time into the course and learning to code, you should think again.
    - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
      answer: Simple. Put all your time and focus into the course while you're there. Eat, sleep, shit code, period. Ask a lot of questions and make sure you understand something before you move on. Make sure you never ask the same question two times - it's lazy (and nothing irritates a coach as much as a lazy student).

      - question: Can you talk a little bit about who you are and what your work has been until now?
        answer: My name is Gustaf Rudholm. I’m 34 years old and I have worked with e-companies since before the last IT crash. I started my journey with the electronics company NetOnNet in 1999 and I was there for seven years. I gained a great deal of experience there with digital commerce and developed as a businessman.
      - question: In the Fall of 2015, you participated in the Craft Academy bootcamp. What made you decide to learn to code?
        answer: I have always been fascinated by how digital products are built with just a bunch of numbers, letters and creativity. Even though I hadn’t written any code before, I had used tons of digital products and services and understood the benefits of learning more about programming.
      - question: Vad skulle du säga var det viktigaste effekten av att du deltog på Craft Academy?
        answer: Att jag nu kodar mer eller mindre på heltid och gör saker som jag bara kunde drömma om att göra innan jag gick bootcampen. Jag var otroligt nära att inte våga ta steget men nu kan jag inte ens förstå hur jag kunde tveka. De 12 veckorna visade sig vara en av de bästa investeringarna jag har gjort i mig själv!
      - question: What would you say was the most important result of your time with Craft Academy?
        answer: That I now code more or less full-time and make things that I only could have dreamed about doing before I participated in the bootcamp. I was very close to deciding not to enroll but now I can barely understand how I could have hesitated. Those twelve weeks have proved to be one of the best investments I have made in myself!
      - question: What advice would you give someone who is thinking about enrolling in the bootcamp?
        answer: Just do it! I have a hard time thinking of better ways to ensure one’s future. Whether you work as a developer or not, you’ll gain a huge benefit from your experiences with Craft Academy. Code is a global language, as important to understand as English. Without that understanding, it will be very difficult to keep up with the future job market.
